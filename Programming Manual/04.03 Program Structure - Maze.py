# ## Extended Example: Maze
# 
# In this section we write a program to generate a random maze. We will
# use Aldous-Broder's algorithm, which goes as follows:
# 
# > Start with a maze grid with all walls up (a bunch of individual,
# > walled cells). Pick a point, and move to a neighboring cell at random.
# > If the new cell has all of its walls still up, then knock the walls
# > down between the previous cell and the new cell. Keep moving to
# > neighboring cells until all cells have been visited.
# 
# We will start with the recipe, and then break each piece down into
# pieces.
# 
# - Make Maze
# - Draw Maze
# 
# then we expand those pieces
# 
# - Make Maze
#   - Initialize Maze
#   - Pick a point
#   - Move to a neighboring cell at random
#   - If the new cell has all of its walls still up...
#     - Knock the walls down between the previous cell and the new cell
#   - Keep moving to neighboring cells until all cells have been visited. â†’ this turns into a while loop
# - Draw Maze
#   - For all of the rows...
#     - Draw one row of the maze
# 
# then we structure the while-loop
# 
# - Make Maze
#   - Initialize Maze
#   - Pick a cell
#   - Count this cell as visited
#   - While we still have cells to visit...
#     - Move to a neighboring cell at random
#     - If the new cell has all of its walls still up...
#   - Knock the walls down between the previous cell and the new cell   - Count this new cell as visited
# - Draw Maze
#   - For all of the rows...
#     - Draw one row of the maze
# 
# At this point we have to make some decisions about how to represent the
# maze itself. Pretty much we need to have a number of rows and columns
# for the maze, and know which walls are up for the particular cell. For
# example, say we have the following 3x3 maze, and a summary of the
# information to describe this maze:
# 
#                        +--+--+--+
#                        |        |
#                        +--+  +--+
#                        |        |
#                        +--+  +  +
#                        |     |  |
#                        +--+--+--+
# 
# The information in this maze is the following (recall that Python lists index starting from 0 not 1, so rows and columns are numbered from 0):
# 
# | Index | Row | Column | N | E | W | S |
# |-------|-----|--------|---|---|---|---|
# | 0     | 0   | 0      | y | n | y | y |
# | 1     | 1   | 0      | y | n | y | y |
# | 2     | 2   | 0      | y | n | y | y |
# | 3     | 0   | 1      | y | n | n | n |
# | 4     | 1   | 1      | n | n | n | n |
# | 5     | 2   | 1      | n | y | n | y |
# | 6     | 0   | 2      | y | y | n | y |
# | 7     | 1   | 2      | y | y | n | n |
# | 8     | 2   | 2      | n | y | y | y |

# We could have 4 separate lists (or lists of lists, to get 2-D structure)
# representing north, south, east, and west walls, or we can be a bit more
# clever and do it in one. If we assign the following values:
# 
#     M =
# 
#       11   8  13
#       11   0  12
#       11   5   7
# 

# Here I have set the following values: 
# $$N=8$$
# $$E=4$$
# $$W=2$$
# $$S=1$$
# 
# and simply added them up. In that way, all of the possible combinations
# of walls are specified by a single number from 0 (no walls) to 15 (all
# walls = 8+4+2+1). We will want a conversion between this number format
# to a length 4 list specifying the walls in North, East, West, and South
# directions (I'll refer to this length-4 list format as the NEWS format).
# To go from NEWS format to number format we just simply add up the values
# of $N$, $E$, $W$, and $S$ for every element of the NEWS list which is 1.
